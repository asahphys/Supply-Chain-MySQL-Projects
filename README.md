This project presents an SQL-based supply chain analysis using the Richard’s Supply database, which contains two years of customer orders, product information, and supplier data. The repository includes database creation scripts, data loading files, constraint definitions, and data extraction queries implemented in MySQL, forming a structured foundation for supply chain analysis.

The analysis addresses business-driven SQL questions such as product demand evaluation, discount and savings analysis, supplier competition, and customer–supplier relationships based on country. It also examines products for which the UK is dependent on foreign suppliers, with results supported by well-documented SQL queries and structured project documentation.
